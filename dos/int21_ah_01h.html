<a href="int21.html#ah=01h" class="ttydoc">INT 21h</a> AH=01H Character Input with echo
────────────────────────────────────────

Input:
    AH = 01h

Output:
    AL = Character read

Action:
    Read character (one byte) from standard input.

    The character is also echoed to standard output.

    Normally standard input is the keyboard. Under DOS 2.0 and higher standard
    input may be redirected.

Notes:

    DOS checks for CTRL+C and CTRL+Break keys and executes INT 23h if read.

    CTRL+P toggles the DOS internal echo-to-printer flag.

    CTRL+Z is not interpreted, and does not cause EOF if input is redirected.

    If standard input is the keyboard, then upon reading a carriage return
    (0DH), this function sends the standard output device a carriage return,
    but NOT a linefeed, in order to reposition the cursor to the beginning of
    the line.

    If the input read from the keyboard is an extended key code (such as the
    function keys or numeric keypad), then this function will return AL=00H
    and the next byte read will contain the second byte of the extended key
    code.

    Extended key codes returned by this function are the same BIOS scan codes
    returned in AH by INT 16h function AH=00H.
