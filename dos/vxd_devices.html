All Windows VXD devices, ordered by name and type.

VXD device driver list. The name listed is the name of the file on disk.
Included with the name is the device name in the driver header on disk, which
can differ from the actual name when loaded into memory. Some drivers have no
name on disk whatsoever, and create the name when initialized.

Some VXDs are "built in" to the Windows kernel. These are stored in an
executable file that is loaded on booting the Windows kernel, located in the
SYSTEM directory. The MS-DOS stub of this executable file starts up the Windows
kernel and the "extended" EXE contains the built-in drivers.

    Windows 3.0         WIN386.EXE (W3)
    Windows 3.1         WIN386.EXE (W3)
    Windows 95          VMM32.VXD (W4)
    Windows 98          VMM32.VXD (W4)
    Windows ME          VMM32.VXD (W4)

These built-in drivers can be referred to in SYSTEM.INI by an asterisk followed
by the name (listed in the file) of the VXD.

The following list shows the device= name you use in SYSTEM.INI, the name of
the VXD listed in the monolithic package, the VXD device name, the ID, and a
description.
