All MS-DOS devices, ordered by name and type.

MS-DOS device driver list. The name listed is the name of the file on disk.
Included with the name is the device name in the driver header on disk, which
can differ from the actual name when loaded into memory. Some drivers have no
name on disk whatsoever, and create the name when initialized.

Block devices do not have names. The same 8-byte field is used for another
purpose instead. They are listed here with the Device column empty.

MS-DOS device drivers are normally in a flat binary format, which is loaded
as-is into memory and linked into the device chain. In this format the first
0x12 bytes contain the next pointer (initialized on disk to FFFF:FFFF), the
driver attributes, offsets to the strategy and interrupt functions, and an
8-character field with the name (if a character device) that you use to open
the device.

An undocumented quirk of MS-DOS is that .EXE files can contain an MS-DOS device
driver as well. In that case, the header is a normal EXE 'MZ' header, and the
MS-DOS device driver header begins at the start of the resident area (just
after the header). The resident portion of the EXE is loaded into memory, and
then called into just the same as the flat binary format of a driver.

As stated above, DOS drivers are free to change the device name in the header
at any time including initialization. In some cases, the name on disk is a
dummy string or completely blank.

CD-ROM drivers will commonly pick a default name (usually MSCD0000) but allow
the DEVICE string in CONFIG.SYS to pick a different name.

Block devices do not have device driver names.

MS-DOS character device list. Name listed is the name of device when loaded in
memory. Only devices with a consistent name are listed. Devices that allow the
user to change the name (such as CD-ROM drivers) are not listed. This list
includes drivers that are "built in" to the DOS kernel.
