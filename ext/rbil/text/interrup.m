INT 2F - Novell NetWare - Adv NetWare 4.0 DOS Requester - GET VLM CALL ADDRESS
	AX = 7A20h
	BX = 0000h
Return: AX = 0000h on success (installed)
	    ES:BX -> far call address for DOS Requester (see #02859)
Notes:	the DOS Requester replaces the NetWare Shell (ANETx, NETx) on
	  NetWare LAN's as of the release of Advanced NetWare 4.0 (1993).  It
	  is backward compatible with NetWare 2.1x through 3.11 servers as
	  well.	 Note that there was a NetWare 4.0 in the early 1980's, which
	  can cause confusion.
	this call is used as the installation check by VLM.EXE, which is the
	  loader for all the modules of the DOS Requester
	.VLMs are standard old .EXE format executables whose normal entry point
	  merely terminates to prevent loading from the command line (Novell's
	  VLMs all return errorlevel 6).  The real entry point is found by
	  looking at the VLM header at the beginning of the load image
	  (see #02862)

Return: AX = status code (0000h,8811h,8846h,8848h,8853h) (see #02860)
	ZF set if successful, clear on error
	other registers as appropriate for function

Return: AL = FFh if this command is a TSR extension to COMMAND.COM
	AL = 00h if the command should be executed as usual
Notes:	This call provides a mechanism for TSRs to install permanent
	  extensions to the command repertoire of COMMAND.COM.	It appears
	  that COMMAND.COM makes this call before executing the current
	  command line, and does not execute it itself if the return is FFh.

	CL = length of command name (4DOS v4.0)
	DS:BX -> command line buffer (see #02977)
	DS:SI -> command name buffer (see #02978)
Return: DS:SI buffer updated
	  if length byte is nonzero, the following bytes contain the uppercase
	  internal command to execute and the command line buffer contains the
	  command's parameters (the first DS:[SI] bytes are ignored)
Notes:	this call requests execution of the command which a previous call to
	  AX=AE00h indicated was resident
	APPEND hooks this call
BUG:	Novell DOS 7.0's COMMAND.COM (prior to Update 12) will attempt to run
	  a disk program with the indicated name even if the returned length
	  byte is zero, because the register used to flag this case is
	  clobbered without first checking it.	The workaround is to set the
	  command name buffer to "REM" followed by enough blanks to pad out
	  the original command's length, which will also work with MS-DOS 6.

	  "Incorrect APPEND Version" and aborts the caller
	use AX=B704h first, and only call this function if that one is not

Note:	if the next INT 21h call (and ONLY the next) is function 3Dh, 43h, or
	  6Ch (also 4B03h and 4Eh if /X active), the fully qualified filename
	  is written over top of the filename passed to the INT 21h call.  The
	  application must provide a sufficiently large buffer.	 This state is
	  reset after the next INT 21h call processed by APPEND.
	APPEND uses the byte at offset 3Dh in the PSP
	  (see #01378 at INT 21/AH=26h) to store the flag telling it to
	  overwrite the filename

	LANtastic and NetWare Lite use only BL for the return value, preserving
