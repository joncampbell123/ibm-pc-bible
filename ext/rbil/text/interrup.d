--------b-15E801-----------------------------
INT 15 - Phoenix BIOS v4.0 - GET MEMORY SIZE FOR >64M CONFIGURATIONS
	AX = E801h
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX = extended memory between 1M and 16M, in K (max 3C00h = 15MB)
	    BX = extended memory above 16M, in 64K blocks
	    CX = configured memory 1M to 16M, in K
	    DX = configured memory above 16M, in 64K blocks
	CF set on error
Notes:	supported by the A03 level (6/14/94) and later XPS P90 BIOSes, as well
	  as the Compaq Contura, 3/8/93 DESKPRO/i, and 7/26/93 LTE Lite 386 ROM
	  BIOS
	supported by AMI BIOSes dated 8/23/94 or later
	on some systems, the BIOS returns AX=BX=0000h; in this case, use CX
	  and DX instead of AX and BX
	this interface is used by Windows NT 3.1, OS/2 v2.11/2.20, and is
	  used as a fall-back by newer versions if AX=E820h is not supported
	this function is not used by MS-DOS 6.0 HIMEM.SYS when an EISA machine
	  (for example with parameter /EISA) (see also MEM F000h:FFD9h), or no
	  Compaq machine was detected, or parameter /NOABOVE16 was given.

INT 15 - Compaq Contura - GET ???
	AX = E802h
Return: CF clear
	AX = 0000h
	BX = ???
	CX = 0000h
Note:	this function is also supported by the LTE Lite 25c, 25E, and 486; not
	  supported by LTE Lite 20 and 25.

--------b-15E820-----------------------------
INT 15 - newer BIOSes - GET SYSTEM MEMORY MAP
	AX = E820h
	EAX = 0000E820h
	EDX = 534D4150h ('SMAP')
	EBX = continuation value or 00000000h to start at beginning of map
	ECX = size of buffer for result, in bytes (should be >= 20 bytes)
	ES:DI -> buffer for result (see #00581)
Return: CF clear if successful
	    EAX = 534D4150h ('SMAP')
	    ES:DI buffer filled
	    EBX = next offset from which to copy or 00000000h if all done
	    ECX = actual length returned in bytes
	CF set on error
	    AH = error code (86h) (see #00496 at INT 15/AH=80h)
Notes:	originally introduced with the Phoenix BIOS v4.0, this function is
	  now supported by most newer BIOSes, since various versions of Windows
	  call it to find out about the system memory
	a maximum of 20 bytes will be transferred at one time, even if ECX is
	  higher; some BIOSes (e.g. Award Modular BIOS v4.50PG) ignore the
	  value of ECX on entry, and always copy 20 bytes
	some BIOSes expect the high word of EAX to be clear on entry, i.e.
	  EAX=0000E820h
	if this function is not supported, an application should fall back
	  to AX=E802h, AX=E801h, and then AH=88h
	the BIOS is permitted to return a nonzero continuation value in EBX
	  and indicate that the end of the list has already been reached by
	  returning with CF set on the next iteration
	this function will return base memory and ISA/PCI memory contiguous
	  with base memory as normal memory ranges; it will indicate
	  chipset-defined address holes which are not in use and motherboard
	  memory-mapped devices, and all occurrences of the system BIOS as
	  reserved; standard PC address ranges will not be reported

--------B-1600-------------------------------
INT 16 - KEYBOARD - GET KEYSTROKE
	AH = 00h
Return: AH = BIOS scan code
	AL = ASCII character
Notes:	on extended keyboards, this function discards any extended keystrokes,
	  returning only when a non-extended keystroke is available
	the BIOS scan code is usually, but not always, the same as the hardware
	  scan code processed by INT 09.  It is the same for ASCII keystrokes
	  and most unshifted special keys (F-keys, arrow keys, etc.), but
	  differs for shifted special keys
	some (older) clone BIOSes do not discard extended keystrokes and manage
	  function AH=00h and AH=10h the same
	the K3PLUS v6.00+ INT 16 BIOS replacement doesn't discard extended
	  keystrokes (same as with functions 10h and 20h), but will always
	  translate prefix E0h to 00h. This allows old programs to use extended
	  keystrokes and should not cause compatibility problems
SeeAlso: AH=01h,AH=05h,AH=10h,AH=20h,AX=AF4Dh"K3PLUS",INT 18/AH=00h

--------B-1601-------------------------------
INT 16 - KEYBOARD - CHECK FOR KEYSTROKE
	AH = 01h
Return: ZF set if no keystroke available
	ZF clear if keystroke available
	    AH = BIOS scan code
	    AL = ASCII character
Note:	if a keystroke is present, it is not removed from the keyboard buffer;
	  however, any extended keystrokes which are not compatible with 83/84-
	  key keyboards are removed by IBM and most fully-compatible BIOSes in
	  the process of checking whether a non-extended keystroke is available
	some (older) clone BIOSes do not discard extended keystrokes and manage
	  function AH=00h and AH=10h the same
	the K3PLUS v6.00+ INT 16 BIOS replacement doesn't discard extended
	  keystrokes (same as with functions 10h and 20h), but will always
	  translate prefix E0h to 00h. This allows old programs to use extended
	  keystrokes and should not cause compatibility problems

INT 18 - DISKLESS BOOT HOOK (START CASSETTE BASIC)
Desc:	called when there is no bootable disk available to the system
Notes:	very few PCs other than those produced by IBM contain BASIC in ROM, so
	  the action is unpredictable on compatibles; this interrupt often
	  reboots the system, and often has no effect at all
	some PC and XT clones had an optional IBM CASSETTE BASIC stored
	  in the ROM, too.
	most BIOSes will display an error message similar to "NO BASIC", and
	  either reboot or return to the caller.
	PS/2 machines usually pop up a graphical box to the effect that
	  the user should enter a floppy and press F1.
	Some clones display the message "No boot device available,
	  strike F1 to retry, F2 for setup utility"
	network cards with their own BIOS can hook this interrupt to allow
	  a diskless boot off the network (even when a hard disk is present
	  if none of the partitions is marked as the boot partition)

INT 19 - SYSTEM - BOOTSTRAP LOADER
Desc:	This interrupt reboots the system without clearing memory or restoring
	  interrupt vectors.  Because interrupt vectors are preserved, this
	  interrupt usually causes a system hang if any TSRs have hooked
	  vectors from 00h through 1Ch, particularly INT 08.
Notes:	Usually, the BIOS will try to read sector 1, head 0, track 0 from drive
	  A: to 0000h:7C00h.  If this fails, and a hard disk is installed, the
	  BIOS will read sector 1, head 0, track 0 of the first hard disk.
	  This sector should contain a master bootstrap loader and a partition
	  table (see #00650).  After loading the master boot sector at
	  0000h:7C00h, the master bootstrap loader is given control
	  (see #00653).	It will scan the partition table for an active
	  partition, and will then load the operating system's bootstrap
	  loader (contained in the first sector of the active partition) and
	  give it control.
	true IBM PCs and most clones issue an INT 18 if neither floppy nor hard
	  disk have a valid boot sector
	to accomplish a warm boot equivalent to Ctrl-Alt-Del, store 1234h in
	  0040h:0072h and jump to FFFFh:0000h.	For a cold boot equivalent to
	  a reset, store 0000h at 0040h:0072h before jumping.
	VDISK.SYS hooks this interrupt to allow applications to find out how
	  much extended memory has been used by VDISKs (see #00649).  DOS 3.3+
	  PRINT hooks INT 19 but does not set up a correct VDISK header block
	  at the beginning of its INT 19 handler segment, thus causing some
	  programs to overwrite extended memory which is already in use.
	the default handler is at F000h:E6F2h for 100% compatible BIOSes
	MS-DOS 3.2+ hangs on booting (even from floppy) if the hard disk
	  contains extended partitions which point at each other in a loop,
	  since it will never find the end of the linked list of extended
	  partitions
	under Windows Real and Enhanced modes, calling INT 19 will hang the
	  system in the same was as under bare DOS; under Windows Standard
	  mode, INT 19 will successfully perform a cold reboot as it appears
	  to have been redirected to a MOV AL,0FEh/OUT 64h,AL sequence
BUG:	when loading the remainder of the DOS system files fails, various
	  versions of IBMBIO.COM/IO.SYS incorrectly restore INT 1E before
	  calling INT 19, assuming that the boot sector had stored the
	  contents of INT 1E at DS:SI instead of on the stack as it actually
	  does

INT 1A - TIME - GET SYSTEM TIME
	AH = 00h
Return: CX:DX = number of clock ticks since midnight
	AL = midnight flag, nonzero if midnight passed since time last read
Notes:	there are approximately 18.2 clock ticks per second, 1800B0h per 24 hrs
	  (except on Tandy 2000, where the clock runs at 20 ticks per second)
	IBM and many clone BIOSes set the flag for AL rather than incrementing
	  it, leading to loss of a day if two consecutive midnights pass
	  without a request for the time (e.g. if the system is on but idle)
	since the midnight flag is cleared, if an application calls this
	  function after midnight before DOS does, DOS will not receive the
	  midnight flag and will fail to advance the date
	Modern releases of MS-DOS/PC DOS (5.0+???) assume that AL is a day
	  rollover counter rather than a flag, as expected by older releases.
	  DOS 5 - 7.10 (Windows 98 SE) provide an undocumented CONFIG.SYS
	  SWITCHES=/T option to force the old behaviour of the day advancing
	  code, that is using a flag instead of a counter.
	DR DOS 3.31 - DR-DOS 7.03 handle AL as a flag.

Notes:	DR-DOS 7.02 (after 1998-06-06) and 7.03 hook this function and correct
	  the century to 20xx if the reported year is 1900..1980 to auto-fix
	  ROM-BIOSes which are not Year 2000 compliant. On a running system,
	  it would also correct the rollover bug from 1999/12/31 to 2000/01/01.
	  The latter can be turned off using the new CONFIG.SYS YEAR2000=ON|OFF
	  command, as hooking INT 1Ah can sometimes cause compatibility
	  problems with 3rd party software, e.g. NCR/Symbios/LSI Logic-based
	  SDMS PCI SCSI drivers (including all OEM drivers like from Asus,
	  Noma, etc.), some Flash-BIOS software like Asus PFLASH, Quarterdeck's
	  QEMM Stealth and Quick-Boot features.
	Using EXCLUDESTEALTHINT=1A, though, will allow QEMM's Stealth features
	  to coexist with the DR-DOS Year 2000 rollover support.
	Actually, the Y2K-fix is provided since OpenDOS 7.02 BETA 2+
	  (1997-08-13), but although these older releases corrected the
	  ROM-BIOS, they didn't pass all Y2K-test suites and had some obscure
	  and inexplicable PCI problems due to the fact that the original
	  INT 1Ah was called via indirect means.  Newer releases, however, use
	  a dynamically fixed-up direct jump to avoid these problems.
	PC DOS 7 plus Y2K fixes and PC DOS 2000 provide similar, though not
	  identical means, which cannot be switched off.
	MS-DOS and older issues of PC DOS do not provide any such means, and
	  thus requires extra Y2K-TSRs to be loaded when run on buggy BIOSes.
BUG:	some BIOSes, such as the 1998/07/25 system ROM in the Compaq Deskpro
	  EP/SB, leave CF unchanged if successful, so CF should be cleared
	  before calling this function
